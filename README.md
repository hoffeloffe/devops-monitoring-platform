```

## 🚦 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Start the system
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d

# View the dashboard
open dashboard.html

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the API
python src/app.py

# Open dashboard
open dashboard.html
```

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **System Health**: Live status of monitored services
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage with trends
- **API Endpoints**: Interactive API testing
- **Professional UI**: Clean, modern interface

## 🔧 Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# API Settings
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
